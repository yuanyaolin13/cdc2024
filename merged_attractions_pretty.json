        "text": "Cracking day out. A little hidden gem in the Londinium suburbs. Fantastic collection of used cars that all tell a story, a must visit for any petrol head, run by enthusiastic friendly staff. Great collection containing mostly euro exotica and american muscle, all interesting and varying from used and tatty to pristine and immaculate, which adds to it&#39;s appeal, I&#39;d rather wander round a collection like this, than spend time in a museum with lots of pristine but unloved show pieces. All the staff are mega friendly and very helpful, and as mentioned by a previous contributor - the coffee is freshly ground and hot. Ideal venue for a car club meet, which the staff and boss are keen to encourage. If you&#39;re expecting something clinical like some of the other UK motor museums, you&#39;ll be disappointed, this is a great collection of interesting vehicles collected by a passionate enthusiast.",

        "text": "e been a member of NewRiver for almost 18 months now and I absolutely love it. The location is super for me, the size of the gym is just right with class sizes maximising the feeling of group training if you want it but without ever feeling too overcrowded, and the atmosphere is always friendly and supportive. You can plan your work out to suit your preference. I go to the evening power classes 2-3 times a week in the winters and the early morning classes in the spring and summer. 30 mins cardio plus 15 mins core and 15 mins stretch gives a really enjoyable manageable all over workout and you feel absolutely great afterwards. I also did a session of 10 power plate classes which were excellent and saw almost immediate results in strength in and toning. The trainers are like your buddies in the gym. Always full of chat and smiles. The fact that it&#39;s a womens only gym gives a sense of complete comfort and ease when training. Furthermore the training programmes are carefully designed to suit the female structure and body. we are not the same as the boys!! Overall, i would genuinely highly recommend this gym for women of any age, fitness level, beginner to advanced gymer :)",

Along Chamberlayne Road, past the gothic splendour of the Catholic Church of the Transfiguration, is Kensal Rise&#39;s Constitutional Club. Its old hall has taken on a remarkable new life. Inside is a gorgeous little cinema. With seats for 40 or so, it&#39;s hugely intimate and cosy, but with a sound system installed by the same chap who does U2&#39;s tours and crisp digital projection, it&#39;s serious about the experience. Dangling from the ceiling is a mesmerising lighting installation by Bruce Munro, fading gently from one hue to another. It&#39;s a proper community here \u2013 half the audience either know each other or know the Lexi staff, and there&#39;s a true feel of locals. Everyone chats before the film. The seats are comfy, with candlelit tables at the front, and each film is personally introduced, harking back to an era where you didn&#39;t just go and see a movie, you went out to the cinema. There are often Q&amp;As with directors or added bits of theatre here and there; they even do a night where the New York Met Opera is beamed live to the assembled, black-tied, admirers. What really sets the Lexi apart is its mission. All the profits, from tickets to drinks to popcorn, go to a South African charity called The Sustainability Institute \u2013 which means they&#39;re probably the only cinema in London which actively encourages you to drink wine whilst watching a film. We&#39;ll take that. We won&#39;t say more, just go.",

I prefer this cinema to others in the area purely because fewer people seem to know about it so there are rarely queues for tickets and snacks. Prices are standard for chain cinemas. Lovely views of Canary Wharf and 2 minutes walk from a selection of bars and restaurants for pre/post cinema drinks and dinner.",

I was a bit of a gym phobe when I joined but the fitness staff are so enthusiastic and fun they really make me get up and go. Whenever I get stuck on new ways to work different parts of my body I just ask one of them and they enthusiastically jump up and show me a million other moves, techniques and machines. I would especially like to applaud Jordan and Stephen for their enthusiasm and customer service. Im always made to feel welcome and I hope that when I move away I get to go to a gym very similar to this one.",

With just moments to spare before Diwali weekend, the team helped to frame up an immersive collection of 24 pratimajis from the Jain religion - meticulously carved figures that represent divinity - which my wife and I were able to present to my mother-in-law as a Diwali gift. Just looking at each of these one by one and contemplating on their elevated qualities can be enough to bring about focus and calm in our own everyday lives. The Art Gallery did a fantastic job with the frame, suggested we use a special type of non-reflective glass (which we went for) and kept the original packaging intact so that we could swap it back in the future if we chose to. I highly recommend The Art Gallery in Ruislip Manor - they are a terrific team who are caring, attentive and I get the feeling that they love the work they do. Suraj Shah, Ruislip Manor resident",

        "text": "Since I can remember, the Horniman Museum has been a special place for me. A treasure on our doorsteps, I think it can often be overlooked by many in the borough. I have vivid memories of spending what seemed like hours staring through the glass at all sorts of stuffed animals that I&#39;d never seen before - the animals were a lot bigger when I was six years old! Then as I got older I&#39;d be taken there on school trips to study more about our current class projects such as Anicent Egypt and biodiversity. Not many children are fortunate enough to have such an important cultural resource like the Horniman Museum anywhere near them. I last visited the Museum during the summer last year during the build-up to the London Olympics to see &#39;The Body Adorned: Dressing London&#39;, an exhibition which explored the question of what we wear and why. It proved to me how London embraces diversity and that different cultures, however distinct, complement each other in this city and make us richer people. I would recommend going to visit for a long day during the weekend in July/August when you can enjoy a variety of events which take place in the Gardens, like classical concerts and latin dance performances - a great way to end a trip to the museum!",

        "text": "The great big brown brick-clad building on the south-bank of the Thames contains one of the world&#39;s most celebrated collections of modern art. I&#39;ve just returned from yet another mind-nourishing wander around it&#39;s huge halls. There are two things I&#39;ve always enjoyed most about the Tate. Firstly, the thematic presentation of it&#39;s work. Rather than chronological periods, the art is grouped into collections, such as &#39;states of flux&#39; and &#39;poetry and dreams&#39;, which place old classics in new context and allow visitors to listen in on the interesting conversations going on between the art and artists across large periods of time. Secondly, it is constantly changing. No two trips to the gallery are ever the same. Walls have moved. Grand new projects have been set up in Turbine Hall. Art has disappeared and new work has emerged. Read more about my experience and see my photos on Triptease.",

We are going to go back because we want to re-visit the Estuary exhibition because we want to soak it up properly, and although we weren&#39;t able to do it all in one day we think it might become the kind of place we frequent regularly.

Spectacular views of London at night and a fantastic atmosphere that just completes the evening. After visiting the centre, I highly recommend walking by the river towards the London Eye, where you have various street performers doing their thing.",

The rose garden is amazing, the ducks and geese beg for crumbs as you walk by their beautiful ponds and if you are savvy with the trails- you might happen upon the Fallow Deer enclosure-and they are Royally protected by the way! In the fall the chestnuts are ready to fall into your hands and in the winter the hills are primed for sledding after the first good snowfall. I am in love with this park, beauty and fun all in one.",

It has everything that a proper Russian banya should have - a welcoming and stylish environment, super steam room and of course the &quot;venik treatment&quot; dispensed by skilled &quot;banshiki&quot;. At the entrance your are warmly welcomed and explained the basics. You can also buy all the essentials if you just popped in on a spur of a moment: a hat, towel, &quot;venik&quot;, slippers etc. You can take your visit at your own pace, but the expert staff will gently guide you towards the best possible way to experience the full Russian banya treatment. The &quot;venik treatment&quot; is a must. It takes only 10 minutes but leaves you invigorated and relaxed. The welcoming sitting area outside of the steam room offers not only quiet corners where guests can relax and chat, play cards or chess but also serves excellent food and drink ranging from cray fish and Russian tapas to a selection of teas and of course the famous Russian yeast drink - &quot;kvas&quot; that is an excelled alternative to Cola! We really enjoyed our visit and already started to spread the word among our friends and colleagues. So do not wait or procrastinate - Go Banya!",

The gym is so clean and modernised providing all the equipement i could possibly need. I have never been to a gym that provides such a vast array of classes! I do kickboxing, body combat, bellydancing, spinning and zumba just to name a few.... One more bonus that i have to mention is all the discounts you recieve being a member, three free personal training sessions and free guests passes. Really good value for money.",

And men&#39;s/women&#39;s/mixed bathing ponds!) so if you can&#39;t get out of the city on those hot summer days, you can still swing by for a quick dip. Lastly, picnicking. Yes. Just do it.

You&#39;ll see light through glass illuminating sculptures, peer at objects through open spaces and see crafted mouldings that come alive at different angles. Soane really did create an immersive physical experience out of the space. His efforts to create and furnish his house with clutter and objects from around the world means you&#39;ll always see something new. I&#39;m a kleptomaniac too, so it&#39;s nice to see someone keeping a range of such eclectic objects that all have relevance and meaning. It&#39;s great to spend an hour here then come back every year. Every time you&#39;ll see more objects and bits of curiosity. It&#39;s free too and near a great pub called The Ship Tavern on Gate St that&#39;s well worth a visit- decent real ale and pies. Top tip: the first Tuesday of every month is open by candlelight. Great for a date night in the or autumn or winter.",

The only thing is that you aren&#39;t allowed to take photo&#39;s, and there was nowhere to sit and sketch (though I am intending to enquire the next time to see if sketching is a possibility). Definitely worth a visit. The gift shop is pretty good as well!",

I have taken a yoga class for beginners and have been impressed by the tutor and classes. I like to come in a little earlier than scheduled and am able to sit in the quiet, green and airy lounge area and gather my thoughts and catch up on reading. Overall a highly recommended retreat for those in need of yoga, pilates and a variety of other relaxation needs. Liked: Venue and location, value and excellent service of all staff.",

It&#39;s a very comfortable ride, and if you don&#39;t mind a bit of cold, the views on the upper deck are spectacular. We had Simon, who was part of the crew, who guided us with some excellent commentary along the way. Travelling along the Thames, there were a lot of things I didn&#39;t know about, and a LOT of Pubs that I didn&#39;t realize had quite the history. Apparently, the crew know their pubs along the Thames quite well! Again, a great way to travel one of the most important parts of London, the River Thames, I highly recommend getting in on one of the cruises.",

Better then the other so called winter wonderland! There&#39;s a fantastic street art / graffiti mural skate park under the first bridge. The BFI is great with film archives and terminals that yoi can browse for free. You can see parts of the globe at one end and take in the best parts of london.

Apart from its high-standard training equipment, what has particularly kept me all these years is its friendly environment; the service has always been excellent, the owners very warm -and often around- and the staff very friendly and consistently ready to help. I am a student and I have even used the cafe area of the gym to work on my computer several times (using the free wifi), as I normally go there after the library. Concerning the gym&#39;s extra facilities, bicycle parking always comes in handy. I also love the idea of the &#39;dog parking&#39; - I don&#39;t have a dog, but I&#39;m always happy to see them when I enter the gym. I have been using the \u00a343 membership, but being a student it would have been very useful if they made relative discounts; however, the price definitely corresponds to the quality of the gym and I have always preferred it to the much more affordable University gym.",

I went into my local Wanstead branch asking for help with a a really last minute personal project and not really expecting a solution but they were super helpful and referred me to the Walthamstow branch. Once there, Elton worked with me on the design, layout and style, created a custom mount and put everything together for me in about 40 mins. He was patient, supportive and creative, there was no pushiness and he genuinely seemed to want to help. The finished product was perfect and the happy couple loved it! So refreshing to have such brilliant customer service and high quality work at really reasonable prices. Have already taken a friend to my local branch since and will definitely be going again.

The treatments are excellent, very professional, using good quality products, which makes a big difference. The location and studio is very tranquil, the treatment which I took, waxing, was done very well and Sylvester takes time to explain and put clients at ease. They provide friendly and good advice on products for the skin, grooming tips and after care. Would suit first timers to waxing, as much as it would suit regulars as well. The prices are competitive and suitably priced for the service and treatments provided. The equipment and relaxing music, with very calm environment, also helps clients relax. I would recommend Tranquilstate for male grooming and visit again.",

        "text": "I first passed through the doors of crossift in April with really low self esteem and at the end of my rope when it came to working out..I had tried everything from boxing to bikram yoga and after some research i found myself in the very capable hands of Andrew at crossfit London and my life hasn&#39;t been the same since...I am now crossfitter who can&#39;t get enough of it who is also about 26pounds lighter and for the first time in ages genuinely happy :-D. Everyone here is super friendly and i feel more like I&#39;m part of a family rather than a gym. Crossfitt is way of life and this &#39;gym&#39; is a great starting point in changing how you feel and what you&#39;re able to do with your body.",

We had the advantage of visiting on a sunny summer&#39;s day and so could truly enjoy the outside area of the tour!

Started off just having my waxing done there (where they introduced me to hot wax which makes the whole thing so much less painful). I now have everything done there - nails, facials and waxing. They also do some great monthly deals too and I can never resist those as they are such great value. It&#39;s such a gorgeous place and all of the staff are very professional and friendly without being over familiar which I love. Thank you Amara for looking after me for so long - you&#39;re awesome!

I was in Africa the last time that I found a park so incredible that it nearly rendered me speechless. It&#39;s crazy to think that a place that feels so remote and special is just a few tube stops away. If you&#39;re from out of town and wondering if it&#39;s worth the trip, please know that it is.

        "text": "If you are looking for a corporate style gym with a pool, steam room and sauna etc etc. Look elsewhere. If you are looking for a local gym with friendly, helpful staff, a good range of equipment and machines as well as free weights (downstairs) then this is an ideal place. I have had a great experience at this gym - staff are friendly and dedicated. Most members (even the few muscle heads!) are pleasant welcoming and friendly. There is a very unique community/family feel among staff and members, The studio has regular classes (the usual: spin, pilates, yoga, zumba) and are free to members. When the studio is not in use, it is additional space for members to use. There are also regular social events occasionally at the gym and occasionally in the local area. Personal training is available. For what it is (a neighborhood gym) and for the price and membership deals, this is an excellent place. However, not a huge corporate style health and fitness center, so if you want and can afford that, go pay for the additional but unnecessary extras! All the essentials are here for you to get a good workout and experience and meet your goals.",
